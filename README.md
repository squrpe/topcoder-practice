# Topcoder & Interview Practice

### Description
The files within this repository are my topcoder question implementations. Most of these problems are still optimisable as they are quick implementations and are basic examples of what I am capable of within a small time frame.

## Testing
I use the browser application topcoder provides to test the functionality.
