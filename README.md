# Topcoder & Interview Practice

## Description
The files within this repository are my topcoder question implementations. Most of these problems could be improved as they were quick implementations and are only basic examples of what I was capable of within a small time frame.

## Testing
I use the browser application topcoder provides to test the functionality.
